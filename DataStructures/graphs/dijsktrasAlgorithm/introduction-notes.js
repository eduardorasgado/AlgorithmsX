/**
 *      DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHMS
 *
 *          OBJECTIVES
 *
 *              Understand the importance of Dijkstra's
 *              Implement a Weighted Graph
 *              Walk through the steps of Dijkstra's
 *              Implement Dijkstra's using a naive priority queue
 *              Implement Dijkstra's using a binary heap priority queue
 *
 *          WHAT IS IT
 *
 *              One of the most famous and widely ised algorithms around.
 *
 *              Finds the shortest path between two vertices on a graph.
 *
 *              To find: What is the fastest way to get from point A to point B?
 *
 *              Edsger Dijkstra was a Dutch programmer, physicist, essayist and all
 *              around smarty pants. He helped to adnace the field of computer
 *              science from an "art" to an academic discipline.
 *              Many of his discoveries and algorithms are still commonly used to
 *              this day.
