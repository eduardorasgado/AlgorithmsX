 *
 *          WHAT ARE GRAPHS
 *
 *              A graph is a non linear data structure cosisting of  nodes and edges.
 *              The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are
 *              lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally
 *              a graph can be defined as:
 *
 *              A graph data structure consists of a finite(and possibly mutable)
 *              set of edges which connect a pair of nodes or points, together with a set of unordered
 *              pars of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered
 *              pairs for a directed graph.

 *              |       |  ___|
 *              4_______3_|
 *              In the above graph, the set of vertices V={0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and the
 *              set of edges E= {01, 12, 23, 34, 04, 14, 13}
 *
 *              Graphs are used to represent networks.
 *
 *              Graphs are briefly: nodes + connections

 *                   |  |
 *              C____D  F
 *
 *              Graphs have no entry points

 *              Routing Algorithms
 *              Visual Hierarchy

 *              Path finding
 *              Modeling internet
 *              Recomendation engines
 *              Everywhere...
 *
 *          ESSENTIAL GRAPH TERMS
 *
 *              Vertex - a node
 *              Edge - connection between nodes
 *              Weighted/ unweighted - values assigned to distances between vertices
 *              Directed/ Undirected - directions assigned to distances between vertices
