/**
 *  STACKS
 *
 *      OBJECTIVES
 *        - Define what a stack is
 *        - Undestand use cases for a stack
 *        - Implement operations on a stack data structure
 *
 *      WHAT IS A STACK?
 *
 *          A LIFO data structure (Last In, First out).
 *
 *          The last element added to the stack will be the first element removed
 *          from the stack.
 *
 *      HOW IS IT USED?
 *
 *          Think about a stack of plates, or a stack of markers, or a stack
 *          of... anything.
 *          As you pile it up the last thing(or the topmost thing) is what gets
 *          removed first.
 *
 *      HOW WE WILL VISUALIZE A STACK
 *
 *          A series of nodes
 *
 *          last    size = 4     first
 *          ________________________
 *          |                      |
 *          10  <-  2  <-  22  <- 7
 *
 *      WHERE STACKS ARE USED
 *
 *          - Managing function invocations
 *          - Undo/Redo
 *          - Routing (the history object) is treated like a stack.
 *
 *      There is more than one way to implement a stack
