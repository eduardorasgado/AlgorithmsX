/**
 *      TREES
 *
 *          OBJECTIVES
 *              Define what a tree is
 *              Compare and contrast trees and lists.
 *              Explain the differences between trees, binary trees and
 *                  binary search trees.
 *              Implement operations on a binary search tree(BST)
 *
 *          WHAT IS A TREE
 *
 *              A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child
 *              relationship.
 *
 *              A tree can look like this:
 *
 *                 _______2__________
 *                 |      |         |
 *              ___9__  __1__    __11_____
 *              |    |  |   |   |    |   |
 *              2    1  7  44  55   87  37
 *
 *          LIST AND TREE COMPARISON
 *
 *              List - linear
 *              Tree - NON Linear
 *
 *          TREE TERMINOLOGY
 *
 *              Root - The top node in a tree.
 *              Child - A node directly connected to another node when moving away
 *                  from the root.
 *              Parent - The converse notion of a child.
 *              Siblings - A group of nodes with the same parent.
 *              Leaf - A node with no children.
 *              Edge - The connection between one node and another.
 *
 *          USE CASES
 *
 *              - HTML DOM,
 *                  <body>
 *                      <head>
 *                          <meta>
 *                          </meta>
 *                          <link></link>
 *                          <title></title>
 *                      </head>
 *                      <body>
 *                          <div>
 *                              ...
 *                          </div>
 *                      </body>
 *                  </body>

 *              - Network Routing
 *                  Unicast,
 *                  Broadcasting,
 *                  Multicast,
 *                  Anycast, etc
 *
 *              - Abstract syntax trees
 *
 *               It is a representation of tokens generated from statements and
 *               expressions in a programming language. With the AST, the interpreter
 *               or the compiler can generate machine code or evaluate an instruction.
 *
 *               Example:
 *
 *               1 + 2
 *
 *               This will be represented in AST like this:
 *
 *               + BinaryExpression
 *                  - type: +
 *                  - left_value:
 *                      LiteralExpr:
 *                      value: 1
 *                  - right_value:
 *                      LiteralExpr:
 *                      value: 2
