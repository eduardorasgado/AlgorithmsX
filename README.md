# AlgorithmsX

This is my Algorithms and data structure repository. 
Every notes i get at any course, tutorial or book i take, is here.

I always try to understand all the things looking at different information sources, so you will find
a decent information about the topic you may be looking for.

If you want to create content, feel free to do it, just try to document your code and create 
the proper folders within the correct topic division.

I create almost the complete code examples in Javascript, using a 'low level reference mindset' because I code in C++ too.
If you want to append code, try to do it on javascrit, otherwise create a folder called as the programming language you are
using.

Enjoy it.

## Example

Dijkstra's algorithm by hand before coding, I always undestand the problem before coding. That is where the
difference is.

## Coding competition
For coding competition, most essential algorithms you should know:
